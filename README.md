# Design Patterns

Design Patterns help you build flexible, reusable, and maintainable applications.

## How to use Design Patterns?

The best way to use patterns is to load your brain with them and then recognize places in your designs and existing applications where you can apply them.

## OO Basics

- Abstraction

- Encapsulation

- Polymorphism

- Inheritance

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.

- Favor composition over inheritance.

- Program to interfaces, not implementations.

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

- Talk only to your friends

## OO Patterns

### Strategy

defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer

defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,

all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### Decorator

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

Decorator provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### Factory Method

defines an interface for creating an object, but let's subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract Factory

provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton

ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

### Command

### Adapter

converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.

Adapter lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Façade

Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
